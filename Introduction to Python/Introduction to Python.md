# **Python Programming Language**

- [code](https://github.com/Anvesh1909/Python-Full-Stack/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Python)

Python is a powerful, versatile programming language created by **Guido van Rossum**. It is widely used for various applications, from web development to data science.

### Creating a Virtual Environment
- A virtual environment is a workspace isolated for a specific project.
- It helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts across projects by providing a dedicated area for project-specific packages and configurations.

### Functions in Python
Functions are a way to organize code into reusable blocks. They come in two types:

1. **Predefined Functions**: Built-in functions provided by Python.
2. **User-Defined Functions**: Functions created by the user to perform specific tasks.

**Example of a Predefined Function: `print()`**
- The `print()` function is used to display messages or values in the console.
- It can output strings (enclosed in `' '`, `" "`, `''' '''`, or `""" """`) or variable values.

**Example**:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Executing a Python File
To run a Python file on Windows, navigate to the file location in Command Prompt and use one of the following commands:

1. `Python filename.py`
2. `python filename.py`
3. `py filename.py`

Each command will execute the specified Python file (`filename.py`).
