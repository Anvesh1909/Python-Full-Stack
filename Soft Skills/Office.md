- State the goal: *"We aim to find scalable and cost-effective solutions to maximize our current space."*

---

### **Slide 3: Solution 1 – Flexible Workstations**  
**Explain:**  
- Describe hot-desking: *"Employees don’t have assigned desks, and workstations are shared."*  
- Emphasize the use of multi-functional furniture: *"For example, desks with built-in storage or foldable chairs that save space."*  

---

### **Slide 4: Solution 1 – Advantages & Disadvantages**  
**Explain:**

- Disadvantages: *"However, some employees might feel disconnected without a personal desk, and scheduling conflicts might arise."*  

---

### **Slide 5: Solution 2 – Remote Work & Hybrid Model**  
**Explain:**  
- Discuss hybrid models: *"Employees alternate between working remotely and in-office, reducing the number of people in the office at a time."*  
- Highlight the tools needed: *"This requires effective communication tools like Slack or Zoom."*

---

### **Slide 6: Solution 2 – Advantages & Disadvantages**  
**Explain:**  
- Advantages: *"This reduces space requirements drastically and offers flexibility, improving employee satisfaction."*  
- Disadvantages: *"However, remote work might hinder team bonding and requires efficient communication systems."*

---

### **Slide 7: Solution 3 – Modular Furniture**  
**Explain:**  
- Talk about customization: *"Furniture like foldable tables and movable partitions can be adapted for different team sizes or activities."*  
- Highlight examples: *"A single area can be used for meetings during the day and as a workspace afterward."*

---

### **Slide 8: Solution 3 – Advantages & Disadvantages**  
**Explain:**  
- Advantages: *"It makes maximum use of available space and adapts easily to changing needs."*  
- Disadvantages: *"Initial setup costs might be higher, and frequent adjustments could disrupt workflow."*  

---

### **Slide 9: Solution 4 – Vertical Space Optimization**  
**Explain:**  
- Explain using vertical space: *"Shelves, lofts, and wall-mounted storage free up floor space. Standing desks reduce the need for chairs."*  
- Stress organization: *"This minimizes clutter and makes the office more efficient."*

---

### **Slide 10: Solution 4 – Advantages & Disadvantages**  
**Explain:**  
- Advantages: *"Adds extra storage without expanding the office footprint."*  
- Disadvantages: *"Might require some structural changes, and not all employees may find it accessible."*

---

### **Slide 11: Solution 5 – Coworking Space Partnerships**  
**Explain:**  
- Describe the approach: *"We could rent coworking spaces nearby for overflow staff or specific teams."*  
- Mention flexibility: *"These spaces can be rented as needed, avoiding the cost of permanent expansions."*

---

### **Slide 12: Solution 5 – Advantages & Disadvantages**  
**Explain:**  
- Advantages: *"This is a scalable, short-term solution that also offers networking opportunities."*  
- Disadvantages: *"Long-term costs might exceed office ownership, and there could be security concerns with shared spaces."*  

---

### **Slide 13: Cost-Benefit Analysis (Optional)**  
If you add this slide, explain:  
- Compare costs, effectiveness, and scalability of each solution.  

---

### **Slide 14: Conclusion**  
**Explain:**  
- Recommend the best solution: *"We suggest a hybrid model combining Remote Work and Modular Furniture. This balances cost, flexibility, and employee satisfaction."*  
- Mention supplementary solutions: *"Vertical Space Optimization and Coworking Partnerships can be implemented in growth phases."*  
- Justify your choice: *"This approach aligns with our current budget and long-term scalability goals."*

---

### **Slide 15: Next Steps**  
**Explain:**  
- Outline your action plan: *"We’ll survey employee preferences, invest in modular furniture, implement communication tools for remote work, and monitor the results."*  
- End confidently: *"With these steps, we’ll create an efficient and scalable workspace for our team."*
