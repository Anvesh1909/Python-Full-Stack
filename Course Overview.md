## Cloud Technologies
Python’s integration with cloud platforms, particularly AWS, is vital for deploying and scaling applications. Core tools include:

- **AWS SDKs and services** integrated with Python
- **PySpark** for distributed computing on big data

---

## Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
Python is widely used in AI and ML development, particularly with advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools such as:

- **GPT-4** and other LLMs
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **MLOps** for operationalizing ML workflows
- **MLflow** for tracking and managing ML models

---

## Data Visualization
Effective data visualization tools in Python include:

- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**

---

## Live Projects
Hands-on experience is crucial, so here are three end-to-end projects with AWS integration:

1. **Angular with Django & Django REST Framework**
2. **React.js with Django & Django REST Framework**
3. **Standalone/Desktop Application** with Tkinter and data visualization tools
