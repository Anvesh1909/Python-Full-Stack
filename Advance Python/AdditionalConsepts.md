# Asseration:
to perform debugging operations
- Asseration can be represent as performing debugging operations as per the application requirements 
- dugging can be represent as finding and fix the bugs.
- in python we can implement assertion using assert keyword

in python we do have two types of asserations
1. simple assertion : displaying an asseration error
2. Augmented assertion : displaying asseation error with meaningfull message

in realworld application assertion can be implemented in following phases of SDLC
- Assertion can be implemented in development phase
- Testing phase 
- cannot be implemented in deployment mode/ production mode 

note assert keyword alternative solution for print function

- Example 
- write a python script develop 10 meaningfull usecases 3 testcases for each problem in 1 hr 20 mins.

# Generators in python 
- python supports generators.
- generator retuens generator object and class as generator class 
- the main objective of generators is to read any size of the data without disturbing to operating system
