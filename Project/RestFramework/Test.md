Your Django API code looks functional and well-structured for token-based authentication, user registration, and managing student records. Here are corrections and suggestions for improvement, followed by a procedure to test it using Postman.

### Corrections and Suggestions

1. **`CustomAuthentication`:**
   - The `CustomAuthentication` class is defined but not used in your views. Consider removing it or integrating it properly if needed.
   - If using `CustomAuthentication`, replace `return (None, None)` with `(user, None)` to pass a user object.

2. **`GetStudent` class:**
   - The `update/<int:pk>` and `delete/<int:pk>` paths both use `GetStudent` but have the same methods (`patch` and `delete`). The naming in URLs can be improved for clarity. Consider using distinct views or updating the URL patterns for clarity.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Add exception handling for `Students.objects.get(pk=pk)` in `GetStudent` to handle cases where the student with the given `pk` doesn't exist (e.g., `DoesNotExist` exception).

4. **URLs:**
   - Avoid using redundant names like `get/<int:pk>` and `update/<int:pk>` pointing to the same view. Separate views for distinct operations might make your API more maintainable.

5. **Testing Database Integrity:**
   - In the `AddStudent` view, ensure you validate unique constraints or business rules within the `Students` model or serializer.

### Testing with Postman

1. **Setup Your Django Server:**
   - Run the development server using:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

2. **Register a User:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /register`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "testuser",
       "password": "testpassword"
     }
     ```
   - Expected Response:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "User registered successfully"
     }
     ```

3. **Obtain Authentication Token:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api-token-auth/`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "testuser",
       "password": "testpassword"
     }
     ```
   - Expected Response:
     ```json
     {
       "token": "your_generated_token"
     }
     ```

4. **Add a Student:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /post`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Token your_generated_token`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 20,
       "grade": "A"
     }
     ```
   - Expected Response: Student details with `id`.

5. **Retrieve All Students:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Token your_generated_token`
   - Expected Response: List of students.

6. **Retrieve a Single Student:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /get/<student_id>`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Token your_generated_token`
   - Expected Response: Student details.

7. **Update a Student:**
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /update/<student_id>`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Token your_generated_token`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "grade": "A+"
     }
     ```
   - Expected Response: Updated student details.

8. **Delete a Student:**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /delete/<student_id>`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Token your_generated_token`
   - Expected Response: HTTP 204 No Content.

### Additional Notes
- **Validation**: Test edge cases, such as missing fields or invalid IDs.
- **Error Messages**: Ensure meaningful error responses for failed requests.
- **Test with Different Users**: Verify if authentication and permissions are enforced correctly.
