   - Classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
   - Clustering: k-Means or DBSCAN.
   - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA or t-SNE.

2. **Data Characteristics**:
   - High-dimensional data: Use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Large datasets: Use scalable algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
   - Sequential data: Use RNNs or Transformers.

3. **Performance vs Interpretability**:
   - For interpretability: Use Linear Regression or Logistic Regression.
   - For performance: Use Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) or Deep Learning.

4. **Computational Resources**:
   - Limited resources: Use simpler models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
   - High resources: Use Deep Learning or Gradient Boosting.
